## Introduction
AdoptMeow is a web application designed to facilitate the adoption of pets, specifically focusing on cats. The platform aims to connect potential adopters with shelters and foster homes, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience.

## Goals and Objectives
- **Ease of Use**: Provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for users to browse and adopt pets.
- **Comprehensive Information**: Offer detailed information about each pet, including health records, personality traits, and adoption requirements.
- **Secure Transactions**: Ensure that all user data and transactions are secure and protected.
- **Scalability**: Design the system to handle a growing number of users and pets.

## System Architecture
The system architecture consists of the following components:
- **Frontend**: Built using Django's built-in tools with HTML and CSS templates for a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Backend**: Developed using Django for robust and scalable server-side logic.
- **Database**: SQLite3 for lightweight and efficient data storage.
- **Authentication**: Implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.

## User Stories
1. **As a user, I want to browse available pets so that I can find a pet to adopt.**
2. **As a user, I want to view detailed information about a pet so that I can make an informed decision.**
3. **As a user, I want to create an account so that I can save my favorite pets and track my adoption process.**
4. **As an admin, I want to manage pet listings so that I can keep the information up-to-date.**

## Database Design
The database schema includes the following tables:
- **Users**: Stores user information such as username, email, password, and role (user/admin).
- **Pets**: Stores pet information such as name, age, breed, health records, and adoption status.
- **Adoptions**: Tracks adoption requests and statuses.

## API Endpoints
The API endpoints include:
- **User Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/register`: Register a new user.
  - `POST /api/login`: Authenticate a user.
  - `GET /api/user`: Retrieve user information.
- **Pet Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/pets`: Retrieve a list of available pets.
  - `GET /api/pets/:id`: Retrieve detailed information about a specific pet.
  - `POST /api/pets`: Add a new pet (admin only).
  - `PUT /api/pets/:id`: Update pet information (admin only).
  - `DELETE /api/pets/:id`: Delete a pet listing (admin only).
- **Adoption Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/adoptions`: Submit an adoption request.
  - `GET /api/adoptions`: Retrieve a list of adoption requests (admin only).

## User Interface Design
The user interface includes the following pages:
- **Home Page**: Displays featured pets and search functionality.
- **Pet Listing Page**: Shows a list of available pets with filters and sorting options.
- **Pet Detail Page**: Provides detailed information about a specific pet.
- **User Profile Page**: Allows users to view and edit their profile information.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Enables admins to manage pet listings and adoption requests.

## Security Considerations
- **Data Encryption**: Use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server.
- **Authentication**: Implement JWT for secure user authentication.
- **Authorization**: Ensure that only authorized users can access certain endpoints and perform specific actions.
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.

## Deployment
- **Containerization**: Use Docker to containerize the application for consistent deployment across different environments.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
- **Hosting**: Deploy the application on a cloud platform such as AWS or Heroku.

## Conclusion
AdoptMeow aims to provide a seamless and secure platform for pet adoption, connecting potential adopters with shelters and foster homes. By following this design document, we can ensure that the application meets its goals and objectives while providing a positive user experience.
